# King of Memory
This is a memory game that player need to match all the same picture.
The player flips the cards by selecting and clicking on them with the mouse. 
Two consecutive flips of the same picture are considered a success, while a different picture will recover the cards and the player will need to re-select them. 
If all the pictures of the cards are shown, the player wins. Otherwise the player fails.
